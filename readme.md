Write a function that waits for a button click event, then simulates fetching some data (e.g., a message) after 3 seconds and displays it on the webpage

- Implement it using all three methods: Callbacks, Promises, and Async-Await
- You will get a simple HTML structure with a button
- Upon clicking the button, the user should see a message ("Data fetched successfully!") after a 3-second delay
- Task will be done using JavaScript for simplicity
